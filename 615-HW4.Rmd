# In my analysis of Boston's rainfall data from 1985 to 2013, I found that rainfall is heavily skewed toward minimal amounts, with most days seeing little to no rain and only a few experiencing significant rainfall. The time series plot I created shows occasional spikes in rainfall but no clear trend over the years. I chose to compare rainfall with buoy water temperature, but the weak correlation and linear model suggest that water temperature alone isn't a strong predictor of rainfall. This process helped me appreciate the complexities weather forecasters face in predicting such irregular patterns.
